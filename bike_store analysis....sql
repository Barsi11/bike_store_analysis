#Joins & Aggregations
#1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Joins
#JOIN Type	Description
#INNER JOIN	Returns matching records from both tables
#LEFT JOIN	Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table
#RIGHT JOIN	Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table
#FULL JOIN	Returns all records from both tables
#2Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN (Most Common)
#Get Orders with Customer Details

#1Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery Example
#Find customers who have placed orders worth more than the average order amount.

#Find the top 5 customers based on total spending.

#Indexing, Performance Optimization & Stored Procedures

#2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization ‚Äì Best practices for large datasets
#3Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Procedures ‚Äì Automating repetitive queries

#1Ô∏è‚É£ Indexing for Faster Queries
#üîπ Creating an Index
create index idx_customer_id on orders(customer_id);
#‚úÖ Now, queries that filter or join on customer_id will run much faster.

#üîπ Checking Index Usage
explain select* 
from orders
where customer_id=101;
#‚úÖ If the query uses an index, you‚Äôll see Using index in the result.

#2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization Techniques
#üîπ Avoiding SELECT*(‚ùå Bad Query) use  at the place of optimized query.Only fetch the necessary columns to reduce memory usage.
select order_id,customer_id,order_status
from orders;

#üîπ Using LIMIT for Large Datasets

from orders limit 100;
